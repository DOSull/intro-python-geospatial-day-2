    "# Meet `pandas` and `geopandas`\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "First up, the name `pandas`. According to the preliminaries in this [book by its original developer](https://wesmckinney.com/book/),\n",
    "\n",
    "> The pandas name itself is derived from _panel data_, an econometrics term for multidimensional structured datasets, and a play on the phrase _Python data analysis_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second up, unlike Python, which I find to be elegant and fun to use, I find `pandas` a bit of a chore to deal with. This is partly because my use of it is somewhat intermittent. It's a complicated API, and in many places not very intuitive. That means that its functions and idioms can take a while to really 'stick'. That's been my experience at any rate. I mention this because I think this is quite a common sentiment. However, `pandas` is so central to the Python data analysis world and Python is so central to code development in the GIS world, that whatever reservations we might have about `pandas`, using it is almost unavoidable!\n",
    "\n",
    "I mention these reservations, only to provide fair warning. I expect that much of what we cover today will only really stick for you as you use `pandas` and its close cousin `geopandas` regularly in your everyday work. I'd strongly encourage you to get into the habit of using it so that it becomes, if not second nature, then a bit less of a challenge to use!\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important thing to realise at this moment, is that it's impossible in the space of a few hours to cover all that `pandas` and `geopandas` have to offer because it's a lot! All we can do in these sessions is to introduce some basics and give a sense of the scope of these modules and some of their potential. You will hopefully end up better equipped to know where to look in the voluminous documentation as you develop your skills further after these sessions."

That' i's how the data we are usually working with are organised, so it makes sense to use a tool intended for working with such data! \n",
